Important Information
---------------------

I'm **maintaining** this plugin. Ryan's, the original author, last commit was over a year ago and no Rails3 support was added. That's why I decided to maintain this.

Any help is really appreciated.


Textile Editor Helper v0.3
==========================

Textile Editor Helper is a plugin for Ruby on Rails to add a Textile toolbar above textareas
	
This version of Textile Editor Helper is a fork of the code found at http://svn.webtest.wvu.edu/repos/rails/plugins/textile_editor_helper/ to allow for use with the form_for method. 

Dependency
----------

To use Textile Editor Helper you must be using either the Prototype or jQuery JavaScript libraries. If using Prototype, the Textile Editor Helper starts up on the 'dom:loaded' custom event. If using jQuery, it uses the $(document).ready() method.


To use Textile Editor Helper
----------------------------

Directions to get the helper up and running for your install:

First, you'll need to run `rake textile_editor_helper:install`

To use the Textile-Editor-Helper with a specific text area, you can choose between the following options:

    <%= f.textile_editor :description %>

    <%= textile_editor :user, "website" %>

    <%= textile_editor_tag 'description', :description %>

**Just like writing a text area tag!**

At the end of your form put in the following code:

    <%= textile_editor_initialize %> **Important!**

If you're a jQuery guy, we've got what you need!

    <%= textile_editor_initialize(:framework => :jquery) %>


Then, just save your view and check it out


Simple vs. Extended
===================

TEH has a built-in mode to show only a sub-selection of available tags called simple. 

Currently the _simple_ tags are: _bold_, _underline_, _italic_, _strikethrough_.

To create a text area that will only use the 'simple' tags create your text area with the following code:

    <%= textile_editor 'object', 'field', :simple -%>


To Modify Textile Editor Helper
-------------------------------

Most of the options that you might want to modify (e.g. access keystroke or whether a tag is available in simple) are found in textile_editor_config.js. Pretty straightforward.
